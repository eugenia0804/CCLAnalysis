,1.1,"First, we'll create the same sampling distribution that we created yesterday. Use the model above to create the sampling distribution for the mean scores of samples of 2 students (n=2) taken from a population of 48 students (N=48).

1) Set the slider and click ""setup"" and ""collect samples."" The sampling will happen faster if you pull the ""model speed"" slider all the way to the right.

2) Click the button that says ""tables"" in the upper left, then ""data set"" in order to see your data table. You can drag it around in the CODAP window to wherever you want it.

3) Now we'll set up the graph. First, click the ""graph"" button in the top left. Then click the ""click here"" along the x-axis and select ""mean.""

4) We're also going to find the mean of the data in this graph (That is, the mean of all the means from each sample). To do that click on the ruler to the right of the graph and check ""mean."" There should now be a line in the middle of your sampling distribution for the mean, and you can hover over it to find out its value.

The mean score for our population of 48 students is 3.4. Is your mean close to that value?",1,0,1,1,0,0
,2.1,"Now we're going to do the same thing, except instead of calculating the mean score for our sample, we're going to calculate the MAXIMUM score of our sample. We (Mr. Mickelson and Mr. Mills) made this model, so we can change it in order to explore a different statistic. We're going to change the model to find the maximum of each sample. 

Note: If you need to start fresh just reload the page and everything will reset.

a) Underneath the model window is a tab called ""netLogo Code"". Click on that to open the code. Don't freak out, we're just going to make one little change!

b) Scroll down to find line 29. You can see the line numbers on the left side of the workspace. 

c) In lines 30 and 31 you should see the word ""Mean."" In both places, change the word Mean to the word Max.

d) Press recompile code at the top of the workspace.

e) Click setup and collect samples. This time the model will take the maximum value from each sample.

e) Click ""tables,"" the ""data set"" again. Click ""graph"" and this time put the ""Max"" on the axis of the graph.

f) Add the mean to your graph of sample maximums (click the ruler, then check ""Mean"").

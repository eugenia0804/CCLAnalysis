{"31": {"Question": "Someone looks at this data and concludes that EPD is biased against white people. Do you agree? How would you use this data to support or refute their claim?", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the given practice of Algorithm Practices as it does not require students to modify or design an algorithm. It is a question that requires the students to analyze the data and draw conclusions from it.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "32": {"Question": "What other information do you think is needed in order to investigate the idea that EPD is disproportionately stopping one race of driver?", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the given practice of Algorithm Practices as it does not require students to modify or design an algorithm. It is a question that requires the students to think critically and identify what other information is needed to investigate the idea.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "33": {"Question": "Calculate the proportion of traffic stops in which the driver was black.", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the given practice of Algorithm Practices as it does not require students to modify or design an algorithm. It is a question that requires the students to calculate the proportion of traffic stops in which the driver was black.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "34": {"Question": "Set the population proportion slider to match your answer in the previous question. When you click `setup` button and then the \u201ctake sample\u201d button the model will take an SRS of 5 traffic stops and report the proportion of drivers who identify as black. Take a few samples. Do you get proportions close to the actual value? Explain why you do or do not.", "Reasons": "This question reflects the given practice of Algorithm Practices as it requires students to modify or design an algorithm.

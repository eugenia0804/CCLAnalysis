{"81": {"Question": "Reset the model and increase the sample size to 40. Run the model for at least 200 samples. What do you notice about the std-dev-means and the shape of the sample-data-distribution?", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "82": {"Question": "Compare the `std-dev-means` between a sample size of 10 and a sample size of 40. By what factor was the standard deviation reduced? (Hint: divide the two numbers to create a fraction)", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "83": {"Question": "At a certain point, the sample-data-distribution becomes approximately Normal. What do you think is the cut-off for a sample size that produces an approximately Normal sampling distribution?", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "84": {"Question": "Mr. Mills takes a sample of only 10 people and records their score on a particular IQ test. He is confident that he can make inferences about this sample using a Normal approximation. Why can he do this, even though his sample size was less than 30?", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "85": {"Question": "In real life, we usually don't know what the population distribution looks like. Why can we make inferences about the population mean based on a large sample size?", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "86a": {"Question": "If the filling equipment is functioning properly, what is the probability that the weight of the ore in a randomly selected car will be 70.7 tons or more? Show your work.", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "87b": {"Question": "Suppose that the weight of ore in a randomly selected car is 70.7 tons. Would that fact make you suspect that the loading mechanism is overfilling cars? Justify your answer.", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "88c": {"Question": "If the filling equipment is functioning properly, what is the probability that a random sample of 10 cars will have a mean weight of 70.7 tons or more? Show your work.", "Reasons": "This question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve modifying or designing an algorithm.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "89d": {"Question": "Based on your answer in part (c), if a random sample of 10 cars had a mean ore weight of 70.7 tons, would you suspect that the loading mechanism was overfilling the cars?

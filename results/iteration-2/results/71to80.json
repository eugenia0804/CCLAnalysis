{"71": {"Question": "For the standard deviation formula, we need to think back to our work with combining random variables in Chapter 6. Remember: you have a formula for the standard deviation of p^1\u2212p^2 on your formula sheet! Calculate this value for our scenario using your answers from question 11.1", "Reasons": "The question is intended for students to perform the work of calculating the standard deviation, which does reflect the `Algorithm Practices`.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "72": {"Question": "Later on, we found out that the two vaccines are equally effective. What is the probability of observing a difference in sample proportions greater than the one shown in the table? Be sure to check the Normal condition for each population.", "Reasons": "The question is intended for students to perform the work of calculating the probability, which does reflect the `Algorithm Practices`.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "73": {"Question": "In the NetLogo model above, press `SETUP` and then `Preset 1`.

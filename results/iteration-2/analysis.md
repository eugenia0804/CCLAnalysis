## Result Summary
The accuracy score of the model is 0.6777777777777778
The confusion matrix is as follows:
 [[42  8]
  [21 19]]

## Prompt Construction
The prompt is designed for education workers developing a series of after-class exercises for high school students. The following practice has been identified to be tested in the questions:

**Algorithm Practices** - A question that prompts students to engage in one or more of the subpractices. Modifying or designing an algorithm might involve pseudo-code only but can also include implementing it in a computational language (e.g. text or block based code).

An example input and output are not necessary, as an answer set is produced in a JSON format that lists the original question, reasons why the question reflects the identified practice, and corresponding answer.

## Model Usage
The model used is **text-davinci-003**.

## Next Step
Further steps include: 
  1. Exploring the use of GPT-4.
  2. Revising the format of questions to fit a more structured coding system.
  3. Providing examples in the coding system to call out.
  4. Exploring the usage of Google Palm to enforce explained answer writing.
  5. Testing out non-restricted explanation formats.

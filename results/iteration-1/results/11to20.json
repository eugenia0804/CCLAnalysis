{"11": {"Question": "Press the `collect sample` button 30 times. Drag the word `Mean` from the table to the horizontal axis of the empty graph. The graph is starting to take shape, but it cannot be called a sampling distribution yet... Why not?", "Reasons": "The question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve any of the subpractices.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "12": {"Question": "A school administrator took a sample of 2 AP statistics students and found their average AP test score to be 1.5. Based on that sample, the Administrator is claiming that the mean test score for all AP stats students at ETHS is 1.5. Do you have substantial evidence to refute their claim? You just created a statistical model - use it to explain to the administrator that their estimate is probably w...", "Reasons": "The question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve any of the subpractices.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "13": {"Question": "What was wrong with the administrator's sample?", "Reasons": "The question does not reflect the `Algorithm Practices` as it does not involve any of the subpractices.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "14": {"Question": "On the left side of the screen you see a table.

Use the model above to create the sampling distribution for the mean scores of samples of 2 students (n=2) taken from a population of 48 students (N=48). 1) Set the slider and click `setup` and `collect samples.` The sampling will happen faster if you pull the `model speed` slider all the way to the right. 2) Click the...", "Reasons": "The question reflects the `Algorithm Practices` as it involves the subpractice of `Using an algorithm to solve a problem`.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "17": {"Question": "Now we're going to do the same thing, except instead of calculating the mean score for our sample, we're going to calculate the MAXIMUM score of our sample. We (Mr. Mickelson and Mr. Mills) made this model, so we can change it in order to explore a different statistic. We're going to change the model to find the maximum of each sample.

{"21": {"Question": "On the next page you'll be asked to use the model to see how sample size affects the variability of the sampling distribution. Make a plan for how you'll use the model to investigate this question.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to make a plan for investigating how sample size affects the variability of the sampling distribution.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "22": {"Question": "Use your plan and investigate how changing the sample size affects the variability of the sampling distribution (you can show the standard deviation on your graphs in the same way that we showed the mean, go back to page 1 if you need to!). Was your prediction on the previous page correct?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to investigate how changing the sample size affects the variability of the sampling distribution and evaluate the correctness of their prediction.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "23": {"Question": "By what factor do you need to increase the sample size in order for the standard deviation to be cut in half?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to calculate the factor by which they need to increase the sample size to achieve a specific reduction in standard deviation.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "24": {"Question": "By what factor do you think you need to increase sample size in order to reduce the standard deviation to 1/3 of its value?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to estimate the factor by which they need to increase the sample size to achieve a specific reduction in standard deviation.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "25": {"Question": "Based on your answers to the previous questions, can you guess at least part of what the formula for the standard deviation of a sampling distribution might be?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to make an educated guess about the formula for the standard deviation of a sampling distribution based on their previous answers.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "26": {"Question": "When we're taking samples in real life in order to estimate the true value of a parameter, is it better to have more or less variation?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to analyze the impact of variation on the accuracy of estimating the true value of a parameter.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "27": {"Question": "On pages 2-3 you learned about bias. On page 4 you learned about variability. Explain the difference between those 2 concepts in a way that a freshman could understand. You are welcome to use your book and the internet for more definitions and illustrations (I think your book has a really useful graphic on page 481).", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to explain the difference between bias and variability in a way that is understandable to a freshman, demonstrating their understanding of the concepts.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "28": {"Question": "Ideally, we want the variation in our sampling distribution to be as _______ as possible.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to fill in the blank with a word that reflects the desired level of variation in a sampling distribution.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "29": {"Question": "Two graduate students are studying the effects of a new cancer drug. Student A took a sample of size 10 from the population, while student B took a sample of size 30. Whose results are better? Why? What do we mean by 'better'?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to compare the results of two different sample sizes and evaluate which one is better, while also defining what is meant by 'better' in this context.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "30": {"Question": "How many total traffic stops do you think that EPD made in the 6.75 months between 1/1/20 and 7/23/20? I realize you have no great way of knowing, take a guess!", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to make an estimation of the total number of traffic stops made by EPD within a specific time period, encouraging them to think critically and make an educated guess.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "No"}}

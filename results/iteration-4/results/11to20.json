{"11": {"Question": "Press the `collect sample` button 30 times. Drag the word `Mean` from the table to the horizontal axis of the empty graph. The graph is starting to take shape, but it cannot be called a sampling distribution yet... Why not?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify or design an algorithm by pressing the `collect sample` button and dragging the word `Mean` to the graph. It involves implementing the algorithm in a computational language.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "12": {"Question": "A school administrator took a sample of 2 AP statistics students and found their average AP test score to be 1.5. Based on that sample, the Administrator is claiming that the mean test score for all AP stats students at ETHS is 1.5. Do you have substantial evidence to refute their claim? You just created a statistical model - use it to explain to the administrator that their estimate is probably w...", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify or design an algorithm by using a statistical model to refute the administrator's claim. It involves implementing the algorithm in a computational language.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "13": {"Question": "What was wrong with the administrator's sample?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to analyze the administrator's sample and identify what was wrong with it.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "14": {"Question": "On the left side of the screen you see a table. Click on one of the cells in the row with `index` 17. This should highlight one single dot on the dotplot. Explain what that dot represents in the context of the situation.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify or design an algorithm by clicking on a specific cell in the table and explaining what the highlighted dot represents. It involves implementing the algorithm in a computational language.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "15": {"Question": "Suppose an administrator is claiming that the true Mean score of the population is 3.2. Do you have convincing evidence to refute their claim? Explain.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify or design an algorithm by using convincing evidence to refute the administrator's claim. It involves implementing the algorithm in a computational language.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "16": {"Question": "First, we'll create the same sampling distribution that we created yesterday. Use the model above to create the sampling distribution for the mean scores of samples of 2 students (n=2) taken from a population of 48 students (N=48).\n\n1) Set the slider and click `setup` and `collect samples.` The sampling will happen faster if you pull the `model speed` slider all the way to the right.\n\n2) Click the...", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify or design an algorithm by setting the slider, clicking `setup` and `collect samples`, and clicking something else. It involves implementing the algorithm in a computational language.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "17": {"Question": "Now we're going to do the same thing, except instead of calculating the mean score for our sample, we're going to calculate the MAXIMUM score of our sample. We (Mr. Mickelson and Mr. Mills) made this model, so we can change it in order to explore a different statistic. We're going to change the model to find the maximum of each sample.\n\nNote: If you need to start fresh just reload the page and ev...", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify or design an algorithm by changing the model to calculate the maximum score of each sample. It involves implementing the algorithm in a computational language.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "18": {"Question": "Now erase that data (either with the trashcan icon under `tables` or refreshing the page) and do the same thing using the minimum statistic (just repeat what you did for Max, just use the word Min). Is the mean of this sampling distribution the same as the actual value of the population minimum?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify or design an algorithm by erasing data and using the minimum statistic. It involves implementing the algorithm in a computational language.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "19": {"Question": "Do you think the mean is a biased estimator? Explain your reasoning.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to analyze and explain whether the mean is a biased estimator.", "Answer": "No", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "20": {"Question": "On the next page we'll use the same model but increase the size of our sample (n). What do you think will happen to the sampling distribution?

{"81": {"Question": "Reset the model and increase the sample size to 40. Run the model for at least 200 samples. What do you notice about the std-dev-means and the shape of the sample-data-distribution?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to modify the algorithm by resetting the model and increasing the sample size. It also asks students to observe and analyze the changes in the std-dev-means and the shape of the sample-data-distribution.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "82": {"Question": "Compare the std-dev-means between a sample size of 10 and a sample size of 40. By what factor was the standard deviation reduced? (Hint: divide the two numbers to create a fraction)", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to compare and analyze the std-dev-means between different sample sizes. It requires students to perform a calculation by dividing the two numbers to determine the reduction factor.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "83": {"Question": "At a certain point, the sample-data-distribution becomes approximately Normal. What do you think is the cut-off for a sample size that produces an approximately Normal sampling distribution?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to analyze the relationship between sample size and the shape of the sample-data-distribution. It requires students to determine the cut-off point for a sample size that produces an approximately Normal distribution.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "84": {"Question": "Mr. Mills takes a sample of only 10 people and records their score on a particular IQ test. He is confident that he can make inferences about this sample using a Normal approximation. Why can he do this, even though his sample size was less than 30?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to explain the concept of using a Normal approximation for inference, even with a small sample size. It requires students to understand the conditions under which a Normal approximation can be valid.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "85": {"Question": "In real life, we usually don't know what the population distribution looks like. Why can we make inferences about the population mean based on a large sample size?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to explain the concept of making inferences about the population mean based on a large sample size. It requires students to understand the relationship between sample size and the accuracy of population mean estimation.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "86": {"Question": "a) If the filling equipment is functioning properly, what is the probability that the weight of the ore in a randomly selected car will be 70.7 tons or more? Show your work.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to calculate the probability using a given algorithm. It requires students to apply the algorithm to a specific scenario.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "87": {"Question": "b) Suppose that the weight of ore in a randomly selected car is 70.7 tons. Would that fact make you suspect that the loading mechanism is overfilling cars? Justify your answer.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to analyze a given scenario and make a judgment based on the information provided. It requires students to apply their understanding of the algorithm to real-life situations.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "88": {"Question": "c) If the filling equipment is functioning properly, what is the probability that a random sample of 10 cars will have a mean weight of 70.7 tons or more? Show your work.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to calculate the probability using a given algorithm for a sample of 10 cars. It requires students to apply the algorithm to a specific scenario.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "89": {"Question": "d) Based on your answer in part (c), if a random sample of 10 cars had a mean ore weight of 70.7 tons, would you suspect that the loading mechanism was overfilling the cars? Justify your answer.", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to analyze the results from part (c) and make a judgment based on the information provided. It requires students to apply their understanding of the algorithm to real-life situations.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "90": {"Question": "What would be the shape of the sampling distribution of x\u00af?", "Reasons": "The question prompts students to identify and describe the shape of the sampling distribution of x\u00af. It requires students to apply their knowledge of sampling distributions.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}}

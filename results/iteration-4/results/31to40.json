{"31": {"Question": "Someone looks at this data and concludes that EPD is biased against white people. Do you agree? How would you use this data to support or refute their claim?", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to analyze the data and use it to support or refute a claim. It involves evaluating the bias in the data and using it to form an argument.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "32": {"Question": "What other information do you think is needed in order to investigate the idea that EPD is disproportionately stopping one race of driver?", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to identify the additional information needed to investigate the claim of disproportionate stopping of one race of drivers. It involves identifying gaps in the data and recognizing the need for further investigation.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "33": {"Question": "Calculate the proportion of traffic stops in which the driver was black.", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to perform a calculation to determine the proportion of traffic stops involving black drivers. It involves applying mathematical operations to analyze the data.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "34": {"Question": "Set the population proportion slider to match your answer in the previous question. When you click 'setup' button and then the 'take sample' button the model will take an SRS of 5 traffic stops and report the proportion of drivers who identify as black. Take a few samples. Do you get proportions close to the actual value? Explain why you do or do not.", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to use a simulation model to take samples and compare the proportions to the actual value. It involves applying computational methods to analyze the data.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "35": {"Question": "On the next page you're going to do some work with sampling distributions. Define the term 'sampling distribution' in one sentence.", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to define the term 'sampling distribution' in the context of the upcoming work. It involves understanding and explaining a concept related to algorithms and computational methods.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "36": {"Question": "Before we get too deep into this, let's acknowledge that this is a very complicated issue. The how and why of traffic stops is complicated. Understanding that there are no right answers, what are some possible problems that exist with this data before we do anything to it?", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to identify possible problems or limitations with the data before analyzing it. It involves critical thinking and recognizing the complexities of the issue.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "37": {"Question": "Set the model with parameters p = 0.15 and n = 5. Create an approximate sampling distribution. Describe the sampling distribution in context (Remember your SOCS!)", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to set up a model with specific parameters and create an approximate sampling distribution. It involves implementing computational methods to analyze the data.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "38": {"Question": "Don't use the model yet. Make a prediction. What will happen to the sampling distribution if you make the true proportion higher?", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to make a prediction about the impact of changing the true proportion on the sampling distribution. It involves applying computational thinking and reasoning.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "39": {"Question": "OK, now use the model, change the proportion to something higher (like 0.8). How does the sampling distribution compare?", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to use the model to change the proportion and compare the resulting sampling distribution. It involves implementing computational methods to analyze the data.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}, "40": {"Question": "Before using the model, make another prediction. What do you think will happen to the sampling distribution if we keep the proportion the same but increase the sample size from 5 to something higher (like 30)?", "Reasons": "This question prompts students to make a prediction about the impact of increasing the sample size while keeping the proportion constant on the sampling distribution. It involves applying computational thinking and reasoning.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}}

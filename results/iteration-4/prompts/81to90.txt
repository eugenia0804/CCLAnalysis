        Inmagine yourself as a education worker, you are developing a series of after-class exercise for high school students.
        You have determined a several practice you want to achieve by designing those question.
        I want you to determine whether the following questions reflect that specific practice, `Algorithm Practices`, or not.

        
        The practice is defined as A question that prompts students to engage in one or more of the subpractices. Modifying or designing an algorithm might involve pseudo-code only but can also include implementing it in a computational language (e.g. text or block based code)..
        
        Return the answer for all 10 questions in the a easily dumped JSON format like this 

        {
            "Question_number listed in prompt(eg. "1")":
                {
                    "Question": "Original text of question 1",
                    "Reasons": "Analysis of steps required for students to solve the question.",
                    "Answer": "Yes/No"
                }
            <continue...>
        }
         
        USe `` if you want to quote some phrases.
        
        Determine whether the following 10 questions reflect the given practice or not
        (Do not try to answer the questions):

81: Reset the model and increase the sample size to 40. Run the model for at least 200 samples. What do you notice about the std-dev-means and the shape of the sample-data-distribution?
82: Compare the `std-dev-means` between a sample size of 10 and a sample size of 40. By what factor was the standard deviation reduced? (Hint: divide the two numbers to create a fraction)
83: At a certain point, the sample-data-distribution becomes approximately Normal. What do you think is the cut-off for a sample size that produces an approximately Normal sampling distribution?
84: Mr. Mills takes a sample of only 10 people and records their score on a particular IQ test. He is confident that he can make inferences about this sample using a Normal approximation. Why can he do this, even though his sample size was less than 30?


85: In real life, we usually don't know what the population distribution looks like. Why can we make inferences about the population mean based on a large sample size?


86: a) If the filling equipment is functioning properly, what is the probability that the weight of the ore in a randomly selected car will be 70.7 tons or more?  Show your work.


87: b)  Suppose that the weight of ore in a randomly selected car is 70.7 tons.  Would that fact make you suspect that the loading mechanism is overfilling cars?  Justify your answer.


88: c) If the filling equipment is functioning properly, what is the probability that a random sample of 10 cars will have a mean weight of 70.7 tons or more?  Show your work.


89: d) Based on your answer in part (c), if a random sample of 10 cars had a mean ore weight of 70.7 tons, would you suspect that the loading mechanism was overfilling the cars?  Justify your answer.


90: What would be the shape of the sampling distribution of xÂ¯?

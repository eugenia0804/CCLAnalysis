        Inmagine yourself as a education worker, you are developing a series of after-class exercise for high school students.
        You have determined a several practice you want to achieve by designing those question.
        I want you to determine whether the following questions reflect that specific practice, `Algorithm Practices`, or not.

        
        The practice is defined as A question that prompts students to engage in one or more of the subpractices. Modifying or designing an algorithm might involve pseudo-code only but can also include implementing it in a computational language (e.g. text or block based code)..
        
        Return the answer for all 10 questions in the a easily dumped JSON format like this 

        {
            "Question_number listed in prompt(eg. "1")":
                {
                    "Question": "Original text of question 1",
                    "Reasons": "Analysis of steps required for students to solve the question.",
                    "Answer": "Yes/No"
                }
            <continue...>
        }
         
        USe `` if you want to quote some phrases.
        
        Determine whether the following 10 questions reflect the given practice or not
        (Do not try to answer the questions):

        
        '''C
        
1: What is the parameter of interest? What symbol is used to represent this value?
2: What is the statistic obtained from the sample? What symbol is used to represent this value?
3: How many samples of size 2 can be taken from this population?
4: What is the parameter of interest for this situation?
5: What statistic are we using to estimate the parameter of interest for this situation?
6: Do you think taking a sample this size from this population effectively estimates the mean score of the population?
7: Calculate the sample mean for all possible samples of size 2 from this population. 
8: Create a dotplot of your results from question #2. Create your sketch below.
9: In most real-life situations, we cannot create the dotplot of all possible samples of size n from the entire population (size N). Why not?
10: Click `setup` and then `collect sample`. What did the model do?
